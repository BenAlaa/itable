# # iTable [React, Typescript, Styled Components] = ‚ù§Ô∏è

This project is a simple headless react table component using using custom hook to abstrack table logic and functionalities

## Context

Let's consider Pectus Finance is planning to create a feature to show user uploaded expanses (you can find sample [expanses.csv](https://github.com/Pectus-Finance/hiring-exercises/blob/master/frontend/expanses.csv) file in this repository which you can use as a mock data for your work) data in tabular form and letting user to perform some basic set of operations over data such as sort and filter. You will find more fine-grained details on this under the feature scopes section.

Here is how the table component looks like:


- When previewing full data
